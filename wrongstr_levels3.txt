Attention dragon: if you ever want to see your mangy cat friend again, you had better leave here at once!\ -The Sorceress

You can go for the course record now, if you want. Whenever you hop on a skateboard, a timer will start. Score as many points as you can until the timer expires or you wipe out. Good luck!
Alright, if you can catch all the lizards without wiping out and before time runs out, I might be able to scrounge up another egg. It's not gonna be easy, though... &Start difficult boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.
Now that you've mastered the basics, let's see you do some stunts! Try using the < or } button to jump off ramps and turn in the air…
Hi Spyro. I found this gladiator training arena and it makes a pretty cool skate park! Care for a test of your boarding skills? &Start boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.
I bet you can't catch all fifteen of the lizards running around here... Just come back if you want some boarding tips from the master. &[Catch the lizards.
Having trouble? If you use the < button to jump off the ramps you'll get extra height and distance.
Alas, I have lost my love, guarded by evil rhynocs at the top of yonder tower. Can you rescue her for me?
Yeah, maybe you'd better practice a bit first... Just come back here when you're up for a challenge.
Hey that was great! And while you were boarding, I found this in a lizard burrow.
Hey Spyro, there are rhynocs everywhere. Maybe I can find some peace and quiet at the top of the tower…
Whoa, that was sweet! And look, there was another egg in the lizard burrow.
This is the most fun I've had since we chased King Flippy on the manta ray.
What! Marco sent you here? I've got a restraining order against him.
I'm sorry, that was the ugliest chicken I've ever seen.
Go get 'em, Spyro!
Well whenever you're ready, come and talk to me.
If you see Marco please tell him I've moved out.
Caught all the lizards yet? If you're having trouble catching them, don't be afraid to use your flame breath while on the skateboard.
Awww, too bad... maybe you'll do better this time. &Try difficult boarding challenge again? &Yes. &No.
Are you ready for a challenge now? &Start boarding challenge now? &Yes. &No.
Now that's what I call a sun! Here, you can have this last sun seed as a souvenir. I think it might be a dud, though.
We usually wake up our rain cloud at the crack of dawn, but these mischievous spirits are stopping our bells from ringing. &[Use the superfly powerup to flame the spirits in the belltowers.
If you can't keep up with the sun seed, remember you can always hold down the > button to charge. &[Press and hold > button to charge forward quickly.
Do you want this doodad? It fell out of the belfry.
Our sun has gone out. We can make a new one with our lava fusion cauldron and three sun seeds, but they keep burning out before we can get them in the pot.
Step on the switch to get a fresh sun seed and keep flaming it until you get it into the pot.
I'm playing a game of hide and seek with my friends. If I can't find where they've hidden their heads they won't let me join the Tiki Lodge. Help me put them back together and I'll make you an honorary member.
When you find a head, land on top of it to pick it up. Then fly it over to an idol body to put them back together.
When you've picked up a tiki head, fly over to any body and use the > button to drop the tiki head.
Are you the dragon looking for all those eggs? Because I saw a shifty looking character with one over there.
Hello Spyro, I'm just off to the Tiki Lodge for some R and R.
You should catch that thief before he steals something valuable.
Those guys ought to be locked up.
Hey, there goes another one. He was really fast...maybe if I activate the supercharge you'll be able to catch him.
Take this egg as a sign of your honorary membership in the lodge.
Well that's never happened before. I hope it's not a bad omen.
Come on in!\ -Sheila
Bluto the rhynoc has challenged us to a naval battle. Our speed boat versus his nuclear shark submarine. If we win, we get the dragon egg he's guarding. If we lose, we have to spend a month in K.P.
Hi, Sheila! The rhynocs have built a fortress on our beach and we're going to blow it to smithereens! We just need you to take out all the turrets for us. We're lighting the bomb now, just make sure to stomp all those turrets before the fuse runs out, OK?
Oh, hi, Spyro! Some of my seal friends are trying to take down a rhynoc fortress! I'm about to go and lend a foot... I love the smell of singed rhynoc in the morning!
Wow! That's the first time Bluto has ever lost! You've got a lot of talent for someone so purple... I hope this egg was worth all the trouble.
This egg has surprisingly good fluid dynamic characteristics. From now on, all of our submarines will be egg-shaped.
The tunnel is chock full of rhynocs and floating mines. The only way to retrieve that egg is to defeat every single rhynoc in the tunnel.
Wow! I can't believe I survived that blast! It's a good thing I kept this egg nice and safe in my pocket.
I don't blame you. I already owe seven years of kitchen duty, and I'm not about to risk getting another month!
Owww... That really smarts... No problem though, we've got more bombs!!!
No problem. We'll be playing hot potato with this bomb until you come back.
Yippee! I'll light the fuse on the next bomb! &[Stomp all turrets before bomb explodes.
Ready to try stomping the turrets again? &Try again? &Yes &No
Stay and get a tan, if you like.
We had a dragon egg for you, but we used it to test our ultra-high-speed-super-fluidity tunnel. The good news is that it made it to the end of the tunnel without a scratch! The bad news is that there's no way to get it back out now.
You'll have to defeat every single rhynoc in the tunnel before you can recapture the egg.
OK, good luck! Just remember, stay away from the sharp end! &[Press the < button to speed up. &[Press the { Button to fire a missile. &[Pick up crates to get more missiles.
Whaddya say, do you want to take on Bluto? &Fight the nuclear shark sub? &Yeehah! &You gotta be kidding.
Our beach is your beach.
Tonight is my big ice dance performance, and these hockey players are ruining it! Every time I start my routine, they come in and smack me with their sticks. Oh, I sure wish I had a partner... someone courageous and strong and handsome and... purple... who breathes fire…
Uh...that's OK. I don't mind getting beaten to a pulp over and over by a bunch of vicious hockey players. I'm sure you have more important things to do anyway.
We did it! That was my best performance ever! I guess one of the judges didn't like it, though. He threw this egg at me instead of a rose. Why don't you have it.
Will you please help me perform my ice dance? These mean rhynoc hockey players keep hogging the ice and all I want to do is dance. &Protect dancer from evil hockey players? &Yes. &No.
That's OK, it didn't hurt as much as it looked. Let's try again! &Try again? &Yes. &No.
Maybe you can be my ice dancing partner in the next Olympics!
Fine. I'll just wait for some other dragon to come along.
Thanks! Let's go!
Do you want to try again? &Try again? &Yes. &No.
I've got your slow-witted furball friend in a cage, and you're going to be next! -The Sorceress
Wow, you learn really fast! Then again, you are being trained by a master boarder... Speaking of which, I was just practicing a nearly impossible new move that I call the 'Gnasty Gnorc'. I had almost pulled it off when I suddenly ran smack into this dragon egg and wiped out! OK, I made that up, but you can have this egg…
I was playing catch with my pet wolf, Farley, but I accidentally threw his ball down this hole and he went in after it. Now he's stuck down there. I feel so helpless... sitting up here... listening to his steadily softening whimpers... don't cry, wolf... never cry, wolf…
I can't believe it! How did you get so good already? Who knows, someday you might even break my course record. Naw. Anyway, I guess I should give you this other egg I found. I was going to keep it for a pet, but I can't get it to hatch.
Now that was a 900! I have to admit, you've got some skills, Spyro. But before you get too cocky, let's see if you can score some real points on the giant ski ramp. Do whatever moves you want, and see how many points you can get. &[Score 500 points on the giant ski ramp. &[Jump on ramp to do half-pipe moves. &[Don't jump on ramp to do rolls and flips.
Hey, nice roll! Now let's see you pull a flip. Flips are exactly like rolls, only you push up or down instead of left or right. Just jump off the ramp, hold down the } button, and push up or down on the directional pad. &[Press < button to jump off ramp. &[Hold down } button and push & up or down on the directional pad. &[Land on the next ramp.
This one's freestyle, Spyro! Do whatever tricks you want off the ramp. If you jump off the ramp, you can do half-pipe moves. If you don't jump off the ramp, you can do rolls and flips. The harder the trick, the more points you'll score. &[Score 500 points on the giant ski ramp &[Jump on ramp to do half-pipe moves. &[Don't jump on ramp to do rolls and flips.
Hey, you found Farley! How can I ever thank you? I mean, I could give you this old egg, but Farley's been chewing on it and it's kinda slimey... oh well, it's the thought that counts, right?
Whoa, you must be a natural! Now let's see if you can pull off a half-pipe spin move. The blue ramps are half-pipes. You can do a spin move by jumping at the top of the blue ramp, then steering left or right in the air. &[Press < button at top of blue ramp to jump. &[Steer left or right in air to spin.
You can go for the course record now, if you want. Whenever you hop on a skateboard, a timer will start. Score as many points as you can until the timer expires or you wipe out. Good luck!
Flips are my signature move! Just jump off the ramp, hold down the } button, and push up or down on the directional pad. Try doing a flip and landing on the next ramp. &[Press < button to jump off ramp. &[Hold down } button and push & up or down on the directional pad. &[Land on the next ramp.
Isn't this the wildest skateboard park you've ever seen? Once you've mastered a few tricks, you could score huge points in this place! What do you say I show you some moves? &Learn some tricks? &Of course! &Some other time…
This one's cake! Just press the < button to jump off the ramp, then hold down the } button and steer left or right to do a roll. &[Press < button at top of ramp to jump. &[Hold down } button and steer left or right to roll.
OK, now try doing a roll. You can roll in midair by holding down the } button and steering left or right. &[Press < button at top of ramp to jump. &[Hold down } button and steer left or right to roll.
Well, there's no shame in losing to the master... at least not much shame... Wanna try again? &Compete for points? &Let's go! &Later…
I'm thinking you're ready to try some one-on-one competition. Want to try a freestyle competition for points? &Compete for points? &Let's go! &Later…
Just jump at the top of any blue ramp and steer left or right in the air to spin! &[Press < button at top of blue ramp to jump. &[Steer left or right in air to spin.
No problem, check the place out for yourself. Just meet me back here later!
Alright! Whoever scores the most points in the time limit, wins! &[Freestyle competition for two minutes.
Just come find me when you're ready for a good thrashing!
Alright, you nailed it. Now let's see if you can do a 900! Get as much height as you can, spin two and a half revolutions in the air and land back on the ramp. &[Press < button at top of blue ramp. &[Steer left or right to do 3 spins. &[Land it.
Let's start with something easy. You can jump off the end of ramps by pressing the < button. I'll show you how to do it once, then it's your turn. &[Press < button at top of ramp to jump.
Just press the < button at the top of the ramp to jump off it. Try jumping as close to the top as possible to get the most hang time.
Are you ready to learn some tricks and take on the next challenge? &Take the challenge? &Let's go! &No thanks.
I think you're getting it, just try one more time.

Please help us Spyro! My friends are trying to go home after a long shift in the fields, but rotten rhynocs keep knocking them down. Can you save the panda workers? &Flame all rhynocs? &You bet!&Um, sounds too tough for me.
Thank you for offering to help Spyro, but surely even you wouldn't be able to defeat all those rhynocs until the power up is active.
I'm sure you have many important things to do, but if you could find the time to help please come back.
We sure made short work of those rhynocs! Aren't you glad I was here to help you rescue that baby dragon?
Heh, heh, that looked like it hurt. You should try using your spin move to deflect those barrels.
Please, hop aboard. Make sure to toast the rhynocs, but not my friends!
Hey, I think I saw some rhynocs run up to the top of that hill with an egg!
Please take this shiny egg, it will bring you good luck.
I'm sure you would succeed if you were to try again. &Flame all rhynocs? &Yes.&No.
Ah, a fine day for a bit of a walk. I was just heading to the top of my favorite hill…
Would you like to try some of this bamboo, it tastes great.
Thank you, sir. &[Free ^ other hummingbird soldiers.
